#Update since last time

I've made a dedicated effort to uphold my commitment of posting one entry each week, despite facing numerous challenges. Balancing a demanding workload along with the responsibilities of raising my two children alone 

Additionally, with my contract set to conclude on the 30th of September, I've been preoccupied with securing future employment opportunities.
